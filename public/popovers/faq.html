<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is a file uploader for my friends and me to use. Very useful tool to share files and screenshots.</p>
<h2>How can I get access?</h2>
<p>You have several options of obtaining access: PayPal me 2000$, 1000$ will go to the guy who hosts this right now, and other 1000 will go on McDonalds, or you can become one of my friends, or friend of my friends. But since you're reading this now and you have becoming my friend in mind, we'll never become friends.</p>
<h2>Why that domain name choice?</h2>
<p>Some of the domains that lead here are pretty funny, otherwise I find them cool.</p>
<h2>Can you access people's uploads?</h2>
<p>Technically, yeah, not only me, but every administrator and maintainer has a right to login as user, inevitably revealing your uploads. But administrators are carefully picked, so I'm pretty sure, any of us won't do that unless there is a need.</p>
<h2>Is there a gallery?</h2>
<p>No. All uploads are private and can be only accessed using a direct link.</p>
<h2>Are there actual boobs?</h2>
<p>I would imagine yes. Just uploaded one. (Saudi Arabia, this is a joke)</p>
<h2>What's noboobs.pics and other alternative URLs?</h2>
<p>That was a one-time joke, because Saudi Arabia banned the main domain. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2H2TgjQ.png">[That is what all Saudi Arabians saw.]</a>, since then most alternative URLs are down, since I have no interest in maintaining a joke domain. That's too much work.</p>
<h2>People on your server are bullies</h2>
<p>Yep, they are. Me too, though.</p>
<h2>I forgot my key</h2>
<p>Then cope, or contact me in Discord/Twitch/whatever. I'll give you a new/old one, depends on how it goes.</p>
<h2>Where are you hosting the server?</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://pavel.gg">@NekoPavel</a>'s basement. Previously Hetzner.</p>
<h2>Can you take down my content?</h2>
<p>Sure, contact me, I'll delete <b>everything</b> you've ever uploaded.</p>
<h2>Can I get banned?</h2>
<p>Yes. The reasons include me hating you, you abusing the service, the fact that we're not communicating anymore, the fact that you're not using it at all, or anything that I find suitable to remove your access. Of course, if we're still friends, you can ask to restore it any time.</p>
<h2>Can I get source code?</h2>
<p>Source code is open since 19th of September 2023, on GitHub. <a href="https://github.com/LMNYX/imagination-server" target="_blank">[Open it NOW!]</a></p>
