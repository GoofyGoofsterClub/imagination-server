<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is a file uploader for my friends and me to use. Very useful tool to share files and screenshots.</p>
<h2>How can I get access?</h2>
<p>Either you PayPal me 1000$ or become my friend, or friend of my friend. No other way.</p>
<h2>Why that domain name choice?</h2>
<p>It's funny?</p>
<h2>Can you access people's uploads?</h2>
<p>Technically, yeah, not only me, but every administrator and maintainer has a right to login as user, inevitably revealing your uploads. But administrators are carefully picked, so I'm pretty sure, any of us won't do that unless there is a need.</p>
<h2>Is there a gallery?</h2>
<p>No. All uploads are private and can be only accessed using a direct link.</p>
<h2>Are there actual boobs?</h2>
<p>I would imagine yes.</p>
<h2>What's noboobs.pics and other alternative URLs?</h2>
<p>That was a one-time joke, because Saudi Arabia banned the main domain. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2H2TgjQ.png">[That is what all Saudi Arabians saw.]</a></p>
<h2>People on your server are bullies</h2>
<p>Yep, they are. Me too, though.</p>
