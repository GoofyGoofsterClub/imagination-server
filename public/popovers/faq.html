<h1 translatable-id="faq-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2 translatable-id="faq-q1">What's this?</h2>
<p translatable-id="faq-a1">This is a file hosting service, like Google Drive, or MEGAnz. We've made it <a href="https://github.com/LMNYX/imagination-server" class="code">[Open Source]</a> on September 19, 2023.</p>
<h2 translatable-id="faq-q2">I found <b>my</b> copyrighted material hosted on your servers</h2>
<p translatable-id="faq-a2">Contact us at <a href="mailto:me@reze.moe" class="code">me@reze.moe</a> with subject including <span class="code">[DMCA]</span> before the request. Include original material, license or any other proof of ownership and links to hosted materials on our resource.</p>
<h2 translatable-id="faq-q3">What's up with the name?</h2>
<p translatable-id="faq-a3">Previously, this service was hosted on several different domains, but now we've stuck with <span class="code">uwu.so</span> as the main one. Some users have their own custom domains linked as mirrors.</p>
<h2 translatable-id="faq-q4">Can I get access or how do I upload?</h2>
<p translatable-id="faq-a4">Short answer: You probably can't get access for now. This service is hosted for friends by friends and is invite-only. If we don't know you, you will never get access to uploading. You are free to browse though.</p>
<h2 translatable-id="faq-q4">Where do you host the service?</h2>
<p translatable-id="faq-a5">Previously we've been located in Hetzner datacenters, but unreliability and pricing made us transfer to <a class="code" href="https://pavel.gg">[@NekoPavel's]</a> basement. Thanks to him this service is still alive!</p>
<h2 translatable-id="faq-q5">Can I create applications for this?</h2>
<p translatable-id="faq-a5">If you have access to the service, you can use <a href="/docs">[Our open API]</a> to create tools. API has no rate limit, but use common sense.</p>
<h2 translatable-id="faq-q6">I forgot/lost my key</h2>
<p translatable-id="faq-a6">Feel free to message one of the maintainers.</p>
<h2 translatable-id="faq-q7">My account got banned</h2>
<p translatable-id="faq-a7">Feel free to message one of the maintainers. If you have uploaded a lot of files recently you might've gotten automatically banned for spam, this ban is temporary, so wait at least 10 minutes before messaging.</p>
<h2 translatable-id="faq-q8">Is there a file size limit?</h2>
<p translatable-id="faq-a9">No, but use common sense, or donate to <a class="code" href="https://pavel.gg">[@NekoPavel's]</a> basement funds.</p>
<h2 translatable-id="faq-q9">Why is this service down sometimes?</h2>
<p translatable-id="faq-a9">We do maintenance every so often and server reboots every morning, if you want stability donate to <a class="code" href="https://pavel.gg">[@NekoPavel's]</a> basement funds.</p>
<h2 translatable-id="faq-q10">Why my link does not include my username anymore?</h2>
<p translatable-id="faq-a10">We changed how URLs work. Your username is still is in the link, it's just encoded. If you wish to have your username visible, you can add <span class="code">?useLegacyStyling=1</span> to your custom uploader URL.</p>
