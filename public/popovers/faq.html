<p>Feel free to message me</p>
<h2>I got banned</h2>
<p>If you uploaded a lot of files in a rapid fashion you'll get a temporary restriction, which will be lifted automatically. Please wait. If the restriction doesn't get lifted automatically it means one of two: either your last upload was more than 120 days ago or one of the administrators banned you. Feel free to message me to clarify.</p>
