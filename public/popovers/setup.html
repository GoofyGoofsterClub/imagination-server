<h1>How to Setup</h1>
<p>To setup the file uploader using ShareX, you'll need to download ShareX file in your dashboard, on the top right and import it.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Download the file</li>
    <li>Import to ShareX</li>
    <li>Select as custom uploader for everything</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If you've downloaded it not through a dashboard, enter your key in <span class="code">Authorization</span> header field.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Test the upload</li>
</ol> 
<p>After these steps you should be all done and ready to upload files on here!</p>
